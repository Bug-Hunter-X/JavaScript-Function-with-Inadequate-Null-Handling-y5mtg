# JavaScript Function with Inadequate Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving insufficient null and undefined value handling in a simple addition function. The original code only explicitly checks for `null` values, neglecting `undefined` and `NaN`, which can lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses this issue by using a more robust approach to handle various invalid input types.

## Bug Description
The function `foo` attempts to add two numbers (`a` and `b`). However, it only explicitly checks for `null` values.  If either `a` or `b` is `undefined`, `NaN`, or any other non-numeric value, it may produce incorrect results or throw errors. This example showcases how to improve this code using more thorough error handling and type checking.  The improved code uses a combination of type checking and default values to provide a more robust solution.
